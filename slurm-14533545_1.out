/data/uqhmcdou/HM_Lag_Recovery/LineFit01.py:241: UserWarning: There are not enough devices to run parallel chains: expected 300 but got 1. Chains will be drawn sequentially. If you are running MCMC in CPU, consider using `numpyro.set_host_device_count(300)` at the beginning of your program. You can double-check how many devices are available in your system using `jax.local_device_count()`.
